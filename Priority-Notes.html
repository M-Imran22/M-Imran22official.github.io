          Non-Preemptive Scheduling
        </div>
        <div class="text">
          <p style="text-align:justify">Priority scheduling is one of the most common scheduling algorithms in batch systems. Each process is assigned a priority. The process with the highest priority is to be executed first and so on.&nbsp;Processes with the same priority are executed on a first-come first served basis. Priority can be decided based on memory requirements, time requirements or any other resource requirement. Also priority can be decided on the ratio of average I/O to average CPU burst time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Implementation:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>1- First input the processes with their burst time 
and priority.
2- Sort the processes, burst time and priority
according to the priority.
3- Now simply apply FCFS algorithm.</pre>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A major problem with priority scheduling is indefinite blocking or starvation. A solution to the problem of indefinite blockage of the low-priority process is aging. Aging is a technique of gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long period of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Advantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Priority-based scheduling ensures that high-priority processes are executed first, which can lead to faster completion of critical tasks.</li>
<li>Priority scheduling is useful for real-time systems that require processes to meet strict timing constraints.</li>
<li>Priority scheduling can reduce the average waiting time for processes that require a significant amount of CPU time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Priority inversion:</strong> Priority inversion occurs when a low-priority process holds a resource that a high-priority process requires. This can cause delays in the execution of high-priority processes.</li>
<li><strong>Starvation: </strong>If the system is heavily loaded with high-priority processes, low-priority processes may never get a chance to execute.</li>
<li>Priority inversion avoidance techniques, such as priority inheritance or priority ceiling protocols, can introduce additional complexity to the system.</li>
<li>Setting priorities can be a difficult task, especially when there are many processes with different priorities.</li>
